This implementaiton of connect 4 uses a combonaiton of the base code from the tic-tac-toe game as well as the othello game. Othello was refrenced when refering to how the new grid and chessSquare classes worked, and the negamax tic-tac-toe was used as a starter to build a new version that will work with the new constraints. To check the winner, I scan the entire board using a 4x4 window and checking the columns, rows, and diagonals of each one. This ensures that ever possible win condition is checked. The recursive Negamax function is procedurally very similar to how it was set up in Tic-Tac-Toe, however the evaluation function is was needed a lot of changes. I started by writing a small lambda function that counts up how many of each piece there are in a row (this was nice because I could create my count holding varibales and check thier values in the same function/scope). From there it uses the same approach as the win check function, except this works on the state string instead of the board inself.
